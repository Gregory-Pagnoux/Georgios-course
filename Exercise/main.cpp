//----------------------------------- INSTRUCTIONS -----------------------------------//
// For this exercise you will need to:
//  - Build a data type of your choice (class, struct), to represent one real-world set of entities
// (e.g. Students, Cars, Products, etc.). Think of appropriate attributes in each case (e.g. year of
// enrolment, name, etc.)
//! DONE
//  - Create instances/objects of your data type and store them in a Data Structure of your choice
// (e.g. list, vector, BST). Optimally, the data structure should follow your own implementation. Data can
// be randomly generated.
//! DONE
//  - Implement addition, retrieval, updating and removal functionalities, through a simple console menu.
// TODO
//  - Implement a version of Merge Sort, to sort your data structure based on a "sortable" attribute
// (e.g. year of enrolment, name)
// TODO
//  - Support any function that depends on search (retrieval, updating and removal), with your
// implementation of Binary Search (or, optionally, a suitable tree structure).
// TODO
//  - Maintain a public remote repository on GitHub, with just the necessary documentation on how to build
// and run your code. Include a short description about what your project does and what limitations it may
// have (bugs, unfinished tasks, etc.).
// TODO
// 
// You should submit your work by Sunday 12/1, 12:00 PM, as a link to your repository, by sending me a
// private message here, on Slack.
